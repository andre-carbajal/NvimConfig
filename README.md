# Nvim Config

## Prerequisites
- You must have nvim installed

## How to install it?

1. Install [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Run the 'script.sh' script.

    ```bash
    ./script.sh
    ```

    Make sure the script has execution permissions. If not, you can add them with the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x script.sh
    ```

3. Open nvim and execute `:PlugInstall`

    ```bash
    nvim
    ```

    Once inside nvim, run the following command:

    ```vim
    :PlugInstall
    ```

4. Restart your terminal to see the changes.

**And your Nvim should look like this**
